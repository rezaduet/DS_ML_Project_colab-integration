# This repository is for practicing Google Colab and GitHub integration:

This repository contains my submission for the Google Colab and GitHub integration assignment for the course Data Science and Machine Learning. The purpose of this assignment was to practice creating a Python notebook in Google Colab, writing a simple "Hello, World!" program, and committing the notebook to GitHub.

The repository includes: A Colab notebook with the Python code

hello_world.ipynb 


This notebook runs successfully in Google Colab and has been uploaded to this GitHub repository with the commit message "Added hello_world.ipynb".
